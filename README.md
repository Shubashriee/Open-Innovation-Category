The system will be a portal for students having innovative ideas and a desire to implement the ideas in our campus to register for the open innovation category. 
Students have to provide a detailed description of their idea during submission. The submitted ideas will be evaluated by the admin, who will assess the ideas based on criteria such as uniqueness, feasibility, financial viability, innovation etc. Each idea must meet a minimum score to be considered for approval. Upon evaluation, ideas will be either approved or rejected by the admin, accompanied by valid remarks. Ideas with insufficient details for evaluation will be made available to the respective students for further editing. Notification of idea approval status will be communicated to students via email.
